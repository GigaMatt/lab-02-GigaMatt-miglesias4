### Objective

The objective for this project is to for this lab is to build a user shell in a group of two for a Unix operating system, and concluding with a report detailing our work. My group partner for this lab is [Matthew Iglesias](https://github.com/miglesias4). Lab demos will be done individually with the TA.

### Directory Structure

The directory structure used herein to manage documents and files is as follows:

At the top level, files describing the project meant for users to read: ```README.md```. The only other files that would be expected here is a ```.gitignore``` file, listing files and/or folders which Git should ignore and a ```.git``` file, containing git metadata. There are two subdirectories of this structure: ```/src``` and ```/test```.

All source code related to this project is located in the ```/src``` subdirectory.

All test code related to this project is located in the ```/test``` subdirectory.

### How To Compile & Run

1. Using a Linux VM, navigate to the ```/src``` subdirectory via the terminal
2. Enter the following command to compile the program</br>
  ```sudo make```</br>
3. Enter the following command to execute the program</br>
  ```./<program_name>.o```

### Dependancies

1. A Linux-based virtual machine OR
2. A Linux-based machine (Note: This should be reserved for advanced users)

### Warnings

* Although the dependencies call for the use of a virual machine, you may use a local Linux OS to compile & execute this code. This should be reserved for advanced users
